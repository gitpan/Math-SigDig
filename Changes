Revision history for Perl extension IO::Pipe::Producer.

1.0  2003/03/07 by robleach

    Initial version.

1.1  2005/04/11 by robleach

    I added the ability to return handles on both standard output and standard
    error (when called in array context).  I also added a subroutine to do the
    same thing with a system call (as opposed to a subroutine call).

1.2  2005/04/11 by robleach

    I added the ability to return handles on both standard output and standard
    error (when called in array context).  I also added a subroutine to do the
    same thing with a system call (as opposed to a subroutine call).

1.3  2005/04/11 by robleach

    This is a modular version of producer_fork.pl.  I changed the method names,
    made a constructor, and changed the documentation.  It now ISA IO::Pipe and
    all the file handles returned are IO::Pipe::Producer instances.

1.4  2005/05/04 by robleach

    I incorporated Carp.pm, pod documentation, created $Producer::VERSION and
    $Producer::errstr variables, and edited/updated some comments.
