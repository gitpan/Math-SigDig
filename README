  What is it?
  -----------

  Math::SigDig is a module that provides methods to round a number to a
  specified number of significant digits and count the number of significant
  digits.  It allows you to edit numbers to a significant number of digits
  (whether they include a decimal point or not).  In scientific endeavors, the
  number of digits that are "significant" in the result of a calculation using
  2 numbers is frequently the number of significant digits in the number with
  the least number of significant digits (e.g. 2.0 * 232.12 = 464.24, where
  464.24 is reduced to 2 significant digits: 460).
